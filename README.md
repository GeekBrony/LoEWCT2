# LoEWCT2
The successor  to the [LoEWCT] Legends of Equestria Private Server, built from the ground up instead of being entirely based off mlkj's private server (even though some code from it is still being used, such as ```dataType.h/.cpp```, ```serialize.h/.cpp``` and some parts of the ```processPendingDatagrams()``` functions).

This Private Server mainly aims to recreate some necesary parts of how PNet2 works with the newer versions of LoE in C++ using the Qt Framework.

_Notice: A lot of the code currently is very barebones and quite rough, I am still figuring out how am I supposed to set this up as I read packets and PNet2 source code. I am a novice at reverse engineering, so bare with me._

### Notice about old [LoEWCT] versions

I will no longer work on or maintain them, I feel like I no longer want to work with the mess I have done to an existing project in order to add certain features I wanted to add, these include:
* The Original [LoEWCT] server, last version being v0.6.0 BETA.
* LoE Movie Maker, last version being v1.1 with [LoEWCT] v0.6.1.
* That [LoEWCT] Remake repository, honestly, it was silly of me making a repo about [LoEWCT] and it being a remake I attempted to do and not just uploading the source code I had of the [LoEWCT] server on that repo. 

These [LoEWCT] versions are all deprecated and discontinued for now on. The [LoEWCT] remake repo will be deleted once a working LoEWCT2 server is made.
